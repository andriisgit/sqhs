# Simple quiz for HRs and students
I just started AND NOT FINISHED yet this Wordpress plugin for helping creating fast categorized quiz

Requires WordPress at least v4.7

Simple quiz can be used by HRs, students, marketers, etc.
You can to create a quizzes with afterquestion explain screen, and predefined afterquiz screens that includes
contact form and presents depending on result.
Quizzes and questions can be grouped into categories.
For launching the quiz just put a shortcode like [SQHS Set=1,3,2]
